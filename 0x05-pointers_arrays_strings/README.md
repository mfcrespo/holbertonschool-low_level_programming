Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are pointers and how to use them
What are arrays and how to use them
What are the differences between pointers and arrays
How to use strings and how to manipulate them
Scope of variables

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
Dont forget to push your header file

More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.

Tasks

0. 0-reset_to_98.c: Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. 

1. 1-swap.c: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

2. 2-strlen.c: Write a function that returns the length of a string.

3. 3-puts.c: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

4. 4-print_rev.c: Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5. 5-rev_string.c: Write a function that reverses a string.

6. 6-puts2.c: Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7. 7-puts_half.c: Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

8. 8-print_array.c: Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

9. 9-strcpy.c: Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest
