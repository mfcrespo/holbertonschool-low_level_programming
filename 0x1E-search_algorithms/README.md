## **0x1E. C - Search AlgorithmsL**

## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### **General**
+ What is a search algorithm
+ What is a linear search
+ What is a binary search
+ What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## **Requirements**

### **General**
+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
+ Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc,  is forbidden.
+ In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
+ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
+ Dont forget to push your header file
+ All your header files should be include guarded

# **Tasks**

0. Linear search: Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

1. Binary search: Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

2. Big O #0: What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?

3. Big O #1: What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?

4. Big O #2 mandatory
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

5. Big O #3: What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

6. Big O #4: What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
