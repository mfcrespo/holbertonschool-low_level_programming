0x08. C - Recursion

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is recursion
How to implement recursion
In what situations you should implement recursion
In what situations you shouldnt implement recursion
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
Dont forget to push your header file
You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
You are not allowed to use static variables

Task:

0. 0-puts_recursion.c: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. 
1. 1-print_rev_recursion.c: Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
2. 2-strlen_recursion.c: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
3. 3-factorial.c: Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
4. 4-pow_recursion.c: Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
5. 5-sqrt_recursion.c: Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
6. 6-is_prime_number.c: Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
7. 7-is_palindrome.c: Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
